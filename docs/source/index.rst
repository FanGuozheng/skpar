Welcome to SKOPT's documentation!
=================================

SKOPT is an optimisation framework written in the Python_ programming
language. It is primarily aimed at the optimisation of parameters for
the Density Functional Tight-Binding (DFTB) theory, and the generation
of the corresponding Slater-Koster Files (.skf) typically used in 
`DFTB+`_, Lodestar_ and other programs implementing DFTB, and distributed
via dftb.org_.


Recent developments should allow optimisation of Slater-Koster tables for
Empirical Tight-Binding (ETB) and parameters for Classical Molecular 
Dynamics (CMD) potentials as well.
